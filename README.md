This is a project where I'm trying to create my own personal library for books that I'm reading/want to read. I will be using my new found knowledge of javascript objects, object constructors, and object prototypes. I also want to be able to display all the books nicely in a grid formation. I also want to be able to add/remove books if I want to.

Note: since I'm not using an actual database, all the books shown are statically already typed in the javascript file and anything I add, won't stick. This is purely an exercises on objects and DOM manipulation.
